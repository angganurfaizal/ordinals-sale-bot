When a sale occurs, the bot retrieves the necessary information such as the sold item's name, sale price in Bitcoin and USD, and the sale's URL on the marketplace website. Then it composes a message and sends it to the designated Discord channel. This feature helps keep users up-to-date on the latest marketplace activities and potentially new opportunities for investment",
